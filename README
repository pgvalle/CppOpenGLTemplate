C++ OpenGL Template Project

Comes with:
    1. OpenGL: https://www.opengl.org/ (Obviously)
    2. GLFW: https://github.com/glfw/glfw (from what I know, we can't run away of needing GLFW or an equivalent)
    3. linmath: https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h (a simple linear algebra library)

How to use:
    First, make sure you have cmake installed.
    Windows installer: https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.1/cmake-3.26.1-windows-x86_64.msi

    Go to you terminal/cmd and move to the root directory of the cloned repo.
    Then type one of the following commands depending on your platform:
        - linux/macos: cmake -S. -Bbuild
        - windows (mingw): cmake -S. -Bbuild -G"MinGW Makefiles"
        - windows (msvc): cmake -S. -Bbuild -G"Visual Studio {visual-studio-major-version-number} {release-year}"
    
    This command should take a while to finish if you don't have glfw installed. But don't worry if you don't.
    Now, if no errors happened, just type:
        cmake --build build

    You should see and be able to execute "exampleProgram" inside the newly created build directory.
